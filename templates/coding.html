                <br> 🐍 A Python-powered app that checks the concentration, pH level, temperature, pressure, and flow rate for various chemical samples to see if a company passes a compliance test. If a sample passes, great! If not, Compliance Mole sniffs it out!

        <p class="project-meta"><strong>Language:</strong> Python | <strong>Goal:</strong> License Agreement True-Up Pricing</p>
            <p class="project-description">
                <br>🐍 A Python-powered app that generates annual True-Up price estimates for XaaS-based License Agreements!
                <br><br><strong>💡 Background / Inspiration: </strong>
                <br> 💼 In a previous role in the world of IT Distribution, I specialized in Cisco XaaS / License Agreement sales operations. At the time, the Cisco Business Unit didn’t have a dedicated team for subscription management — leaving a need for process standardization. 
                <br> 🛠 I took the challenge head-on, applying LEAN methodology and collaborating across teams to begin creating harmony between internal systems and the many nuances of XaaS subscriptions.
                <br> 🧩 One nuance in particular caught my attention: Cisco’s True Forward process. As Enterprise Agreement (EA) sales accelerated, estimating True Forward costs became increasingly complex. Many partners weren’t familiar with how True Forwards worked, and internal quoting tools couldn’t handle the Cisco report formats. 
                <br> ✨ This process had a certain je ne sais quoi that fascinated me.  So, I went down the rabbit hole to learn every detail of the calculations and workflows involved.
                <br><br><strong> ⚙ The Project: </strong>
                <br>💻 This project began as a Visual Basic macro I built as a personal side project on my own time, using Microsoft Copilot to generate 100% fictional sample reports. My goal was to surprise my previous company with a working solution; however, I separated from the company prior to the big reveal.
                <br>🧠 After leaving, inspired by Lex Fridman, I threw myself into the world of Python! Looking for real-life problems to solve, I circled back to the True-Up pricing challenge…
                <br>🕺And that’s how MK:Delta was born 💥
                <br><br><strong> ⚠ Important Notes </strong>
                <br> ✅ MK: Delta was developed on my personal computer as a side project.
                <br> ✅ Tested only with synthetic / randomly generated data and reports — no real customer, distributor, partner, or Cisco data or reports were used.
                <br> ✅ All companies and products in the reports are 100% fictional.
                <br> ✅ Inspired by Cisco’s True Forward process, but not affiliated with or endorsed by Cisco (or any other company). This is a demo / proof-of-concept, not an official Cisco tool.
                <br>
                <br> 📌 Note for any visitors who are unfamiliar with the “IT Channel” – Tech Manufacturers sell hardware/software to Distributors, who sell to Partners (Resellers, VAR’s, MSP’s, Service Providers, etc), who sell to the end customers (Private Companies, Government/Military Entities, School Districts, Healthcare Entities, etc)

            <p class="project-description">
                <br> 💾 On a previous version of this site, data was stored into <strong> Parquet files </strong> whenever you submit one of the following:
                <br><br>🛒 A fake order from the shopping simulation 
                <br>💬 A message from the “Contact Me” page 
                <br>👍 Feedback in the “Suggestions Box”
                <br>✍ A signature in the Guestbook
                <br><br>🐦 I used Parquet files because they’re compact and efficient — but the downside is, you can’t really see the data easily.
                <br><br>🕺 So I built a way to <strong>collapse the Parquet wavefunction </strong>and observe the files with this simple Python app!
                <br><br>🔍 <strong>Parquet Collapse</strong> lets me choose which Parquet file to view and instantly converts it into a CSV so I can <strong> just look at it!</strong>.

                <br> 💡 I wanted to expand my skillset and learn about <strong>databases</strong> so I asked Claude to give me a practice exercise to work through and this is the result!
                    <br><br><strong>Exercise Goals:</strong>
                    <br>✅ Connecting to PostgreSQL

                    <br>✅ Updating & deleting
                    <br>✅ Exporting to pandas for analysis
                    <br><br> <strong>🕺 Things I learned:</strong>
                    <br>✅ Basic Database terminology (Query, Schema, Table, Primary Key, Foreign Key, Truncate, Indexes, Transactions, etc)
                    <br>✅ Integrating PostgreSQL into Python
                    <br>✅ Basic SQL syntax: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER
                    <br>✅ Case-sensitivity in SQL

            <p class="project-description">
                🐱 A regression modeling app inspired by <strong>Schrödinger’s Cat</strong> thought experiment. 
                <br>In this café, your dining experience depends entirely on quantum uncertainty—and a bit of data science. 
                <br><br><strong>The app takes a dataset of quantum-themed features, including: </strong>
                <br> • 📦 Box Temperature = Affects comfort and decay rate of quantum particles
                <br> • 🔦 Photon Count per Minute = Measures quantum activity inside the box
                <br> • 🔗 Quantum Entanglement Index = Degree of entanglement with external systems
                <br> • 👀 Observer Presence (0 = not watching, 1 = observing) 
                <br> • ☢️ Radioactive Decay Rate = Probability of poison release mechanism triggering
                <br> • 🌊 Wave Function Stability = How stable the cat’s quantum state is
                <br> • 🪨 Box Material = Cardboard, Lead, Quantum Foam, or Velvet
                <br><br><strong>From these, the app builds regression models to predict three crucial outcomes: </strong>
                <br>• Mood Score (0–100): from existential dread (0) to quantum bliss (100) / influenced by Box Temperature, Decay Rate, Photon Count, Wavefunction Stability, and Box Material
                <br>• Quantum Sass Index (0-100): how snarky the cat will be if you order a latte (100 = major CATtitude) / influenced by Entanglement and Box Temperature
                <br>• Survival Rate (0–1): how likely the cat is still with us after being observed / influenced by Observer presence 
                <br><br><strong>Why it matters </strong>
                <br>• A happy cat = a great meal at the Cat Café 
                <br>• A cat in existential dread = wrong orders (hope you like extra tomatoes) 
                <br>• A sassy cat = snarky barista energy, take a deep breath before placing your order
                <br>• A dead cat = no meal at all 
                <br><br>This project is both a tribute to quantum mechanics and a hands-on way to explore <strong>regression analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling</strong>—all wrapped up in a purrfect experience.
